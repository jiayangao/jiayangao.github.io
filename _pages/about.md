I'm currently a PhD candidate at Swinburne University of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Zhang]([https://ailab.bytedance.com/](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=junzhang)), [Prof. Yang Xiang](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=yxiang). I got my MSc Degree at The University of Melbourne in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Karin Verspoor](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/v/verspoor-professor-karin). I also collaborate with [A/Prof Lei pan](https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/lei-pan), [Dr. Chao Chen](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/c/chen-dr-chao) and Dr. [Leo Yu Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/leoyuzhang/) closely. My research interest includes Biometrics, Software Vulnerability Detection, Large Language Model (LLM) and AI.
